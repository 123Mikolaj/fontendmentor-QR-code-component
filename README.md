## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to use Flexbox for layout alignment, which allowed me to position the QR code component and header effectively. I also improved my skills in creating a responsive design and working with CSS properties to achieve a clean and modern look.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to explore advanced CSS layout techniques and refine my skills in responsive design. I also aim to experiment with CSS Grid for complex layouts and further enhance my understanding of accessibility in web design.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A comprehensive guide on using Flexbox for layout design.
- [MDN Web Docs - HTML5 Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - A detailed resource on using semantic HTML elements like `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<header>` to structure your HTML content effectively.
